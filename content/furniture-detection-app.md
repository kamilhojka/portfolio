As part of a diploma thesis, an application was created using a deep learning model achieving 92% accuracy in detecting objects within room interiors based on user-uploaded images. This innovation holds potential for streamlining processes across industries.

The thesis aimed to design an application for object detection within room interiors using a deep learning model. Technologies like Visual Studio Code, Python, venv, Git, Jupyter Notebook, YOLOv8, Streamlit, and Roboflow were chosen. YOLOv8, a potent framework for object detection, was selected for model creation. Diverse datasets (Open Images Dataset V7, Bonn Furniture Styles Dataset) depicted common room objects.

The project successfully designed an object detection app, showcasing a 92% accuracy rate. This innovative solution holds potential for diverse applications, revolutionizing industry processes and user experience. The chosen technologies, especially YOLOv8 and Streamlit, contribute to a robust and efficient application.
