The Name Checker App seamlessly integrates simplicity and functionality using modern web technologies such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI. These technologies collectively contribute to an intuitive user interface, an attractive design, and efficient performance for checking username availability.

Developed on Next.js, the app ensures smooth state management and minimized page load times. The use of App Router enhances user navigation, while Tailwind CSS facilitates rapid and effective styling, maintaining a contemporary aesthetic. Radix UI components handle user interactions and dynamic data rendering, ensuring responsiveness across different devices.

The primary purpose of the app is to verify the availability of a chosen username. Users input their desired username and select a service for verification. The app then sends a request to the chosen service, promptly indicating whether the username is available or already taken. Clear and concise messages, along with color-coded indicators (green for available, red for taken), guide users through the verification process, enhancing the overall user experience.
