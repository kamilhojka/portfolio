An application was crafted using C# WPF, leveraging the .NET Framework (XAML) and seamlessly integrating with SQL Server. This application acts as a bridge between two distinct applicationsâ€”one for warehouse location management and another for WAPRO Mag ERP. The result is a visually appealing representation of furniture locations, facilitating swift and precise retrieval of specific items.
