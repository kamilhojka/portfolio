I spearheaded the creation of two applications. The first, developed using C# WPF .NET Framework 4.6.2 (XAML), serves as a comprehensive upholstery management tool. In tandem, a SQL Server database was crafted, enabling seamless integration through APIs with distinct React applications and the ERP system - WAPRO MAG. This integration significantly expedites company processes and fosters automation.

Furthermore, I crafted a C# .NET Framework 3.5 Smart Device Project application tailored for handheld devices. This application, strategically positioned on collectors, facilitates user communication with the database. The cohesive synergy between these applications represents a strategic leap towards efficiency, automation, and streamlined communication within the company.
