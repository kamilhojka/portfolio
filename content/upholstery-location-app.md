Two applications have been created. The first, developed using C# WPF .NET Framework 4.6.2, serves as a comprehensive upholstery management tool. At the same time, a SQL Server database was crafted, enabling seamless integration through APIs with various React applications and the ERP system - WAPRO MAG. This integration significantly speed up the company's processes and promotes automation.

In addition, a C# .NET Compact Framework 3.5 Smart Device Project application was crafted tailored for handheld devices. This application, strategically positioned on collectors, facilitates user communication with the database. The consistent synergy between these applications represents a strategic leap towards efficiency, automation, and streamlined communication within the company.
