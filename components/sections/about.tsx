            Hello! My name is Kamil, graduate of the Opole University of
            Technology with a passion for creating software used in the everyday

            For 4 years I have been working as a freelancer/independent person
            responsible for software for warehouse management, finances and
            other ERP processes in one of the companies in my city. Thanks to
            this, I gained extensive experience and skills that I will be happy
            to use in new professional challenges. In addition, I am a gym
            enthusiast, and I train regularly to stay in good physical and
            mental shape.
